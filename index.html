    <h1>Carolena Revord</h1>
    <p><em>Knitter, fan of Craft Beer, lover of brandy Old Fashioneds & Bloody Marys, paper crafter & Aspiring code writer</em></p>
    <p>I am a happily married woman who is lucky enough to love life! <br>
      <img src="https://carabeingood.github.io/cv/images/meNJesse.JPG" alt="hubby and me and beer"><br>
      I have spent most of my life knitting, and have become a yarn snob who makes mostly yummy squishy socks..<br>
      <img src="https://carabeingood.github.io/cv/images/socks.JPG" alt="home made socks"><br>
    My husband and I enjoy visiting brew pubs anywhere we go. We have even been know to plan our vacations around good beer =)<br>

    Loving beer is an obvious lead in for our Bloody Mary adventures! You would be amazed at how many different ways alcohol and tomato can be combined!<br>
    <img src="https://carabeingood.github.io/cv/images/bloodies.JPG" alt="favorite bloodies"><br>
    We also love to take our Travel Trailer camping as often as possible, preferably to County camp grounds...<br>
    Walking to supper clubs to have a good meal and some brandy Old Fashioneds is one of the best parts of camping!<br>

    There are many weekends during the summer that are spent camping in friends yards, it lets us stay at the camp fires much later that way!<br>
