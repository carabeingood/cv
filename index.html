      I am a happily married woman who is lucky enough to love life! </p><br>

      <p> <img class="right" src="https://carabeingood.github.io/cv/images/socks.JPG" alt="home made socks"><br>
      I have spent most of my life knitting, and have become a yarn snob who makes mostly yummy squishy socks..</p><br>

      My husband and I enjoy visiting brew pubs anywhere we go. We have even been know to plan our vacations around good beer =)</p><br>

      Loving beer is an obvious lead in for our Bloody Mary adventures! You would be amazed at how many different ways alcohol and tomato can be combined!</p><br>

      We also love to take our Travel Trailer camping as often as possible, preferably to County camp grounds...<br>
    Walking to supper clubs to have a good meal and some brandy Old Fashioneds is one of the best parts of camping!<br>

    <p><img class="right" src="https://carabeingood.github.io/cv/images/campfire.JPG" alt="campfire"><br>
      There are many weekends during the summer that are spent camping in friends yards, it lets us stay at the camp fires much later that way!<br>
